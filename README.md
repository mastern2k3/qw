# qw
An indexed task and note keeper for the terminal.
Substantially inspired by [taskbook](https://github.com/klauscfhq/taskbook).

- **Why qw?** - because it's very easy to write on the keyboard, I'm in the early stages of figuring out what would the **q** and **w** stand for.

# Tasks
- [ ] **Port taskbook to go**
